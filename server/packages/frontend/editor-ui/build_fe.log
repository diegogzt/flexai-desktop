You or a plugin you are using have set `optimizeDeps.esbuildOptions` but this option is now deprecated. Vite now uses Rolldown to optimize the dependencies. Please use `optimizeDeps.rollupOptions` instead.
plugin-legacy overrode 'build.target'. You should pass 'targets' as an option to this plugin with the list of legacy browsers to support instead.
plugin-legacy 'modernTargets' option overrode the builtin targets of modern chunks. Some versions of browsers between legacy and modern may not be supported.
